## Multipliers

The formula is `EvolvedCP = OriginalCP x multiplier`.

Example usage of multipliers:
I want to evolve my Bulbasaur with 200 CP. The future Ivysaur will have `365 = 200 x 1.58` CP.

If there are two or more values in `multipliers` is because there is a maximum and minimum of evolution CP possible.
